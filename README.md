# CS3203-GroupJ-UnitTests

This project demonstrates a simple **unit test** using **Node.js** and **Jest**.

---

## Overview

- **CalendarEvent.js** ‚Äî main class definition  
- **CalendarEvent.test.js** ‚Äî Jest test suite verifying functionality  
- **package.json** ‚Äî configuration file for scripts and dependencies  

---

## Prerequisites

Before running the tests, make sure you have **Node.js** and **npm** installed.

- Download and install Node.js here:  
   [https://nodejs.org/]

After installation, **restart VS Code** (or your editor) to ensure everything is detected properly.

Verify Node.js and npm are available by running:
```bash
node -v
npm -v
````

Both commands should print version numbers.

---

## Cloning the Repository

Clone the repository onto your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/GroupJ-CS3202/CS3203-GroupJ-UnitTests.git
```

> üí° If you need to switch to a specific branch (e.g., Cayden‚Äôs branch):
>
> ```bash
> git checkout "Cayden's-unit-test"
> ```

Then navigate into the project folder:

```bash
cd CS3203-GroupJ-UnitTests
```

---

## Setup

Initialize npm (if not already initialized):

```bash
npm init -y
```

Install **Jest** as a development dependency:

```bash
npm install jest --save-dev
```

---

## Configure package.json

Open your `package.json` and make sure it includes this script:

```json
"scripts": {
  "test": "jest"
}
```

---

## Running Tests

To execute all tests, run:

```bash
npm test
```

You should see output similar to:

```
PASS  ./CalendarEvent.test.js
‚úì should create a CalendarEvent object correctly
‚úì should calculate duration in days
‚úì should return true if event is ongoing
‚úì should return false if event is not ongoing
‚úì should validate date intervals correctly
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### Windows PowerShell Error

If you see:

```
Running scripts is disabled on this system
```

Run this command **in PowerShell as Administrator**:

```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process -ExecutionPolicy Bypass
```

Then re-run:

```bash
npm test
```

‚úÖ This version uses clean section headers, code formatting, and spacing ‚Äî it‚Äôll render perfectly on GitHub and be easy for students to follow.

Would you like me to add a short ‚ÄúExpected Output‚Äù screenshot section (for clarity on what success looks like on GitHub)?

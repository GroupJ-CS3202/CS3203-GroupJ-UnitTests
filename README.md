# CS3203-GroupJ-UnitTests

## Welcome to Group J's Unit Tests!
To validate unit tests, navigate to the correct branch and clone the repository.

## Dependencies
Our unit tests are written in JavaScript, so you will need to download the following to run them:
- Node.js (https://nodejs.org/en/download)
- Jest (https://jestjs.io/docs/getting-started)

## To run tests:
- Select correct branch
- git clone repository
- cd into the proper directory in terminal

- Just type the command below in the terminal
- If it doesn't work, I recommend you to reload the code
<pre> gradle build </pre>
<pre> gradle test </pre>


### Before Testing:
- Download required dependencies
- Make sure you are on the correct branch
- Ensure that jest and node.js/npm are both working

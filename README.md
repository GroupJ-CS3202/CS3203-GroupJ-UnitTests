# CS3203-GroupJ-UnitTests

## Welcome to Group J's Unit Tests!
To validate unit tests, navigate to the correct branch and clone the repository.

## To run tests:
- Select correct branch
- git clone repository
- cd into the proper directory in terminal
- download gradle
- Just type the command below in the terminal
- If it doesn't work, I recommend you to reload the code
<pre> gradle build </pre>
<pre> gradle test </pre>


### Before Testing:
- Download required dependencies
- Make sure you are on the correct branch
- Ensure that jest and node.js/npm are both working

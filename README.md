## Welcome to Group J's Unit Tests!
To validate unit tests, navigate to the correct branch and clone the repository.

## To run tests:
- Select correct branch
- git clone repository
- cd into the proper directory in terminal
- download gradle
- Just type the command below in the terminal
- If it doesn't work, I recommend you to reload the code
<pre> gradle build </pre>
<pre> gradle test </pre>
